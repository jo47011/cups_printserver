CUPS wrapper scripts

wrapper: A script which lives in the CUPS print filter directory and
executes the corresponding script from the run-time directory.

pass-through: CUPS back-end script which forwards the given print job to
another printer.

Options:

	server=server:port

	printer=destination/instance

All other scripts are CUPS print filters.

asctopdf: Reads ASC files (text files for enscript) and
generates the end-user PDF file with optional AGBs on the last page.

Options:

	kopie=1		Underlay "Kopie" with enscript.

	agb=0		Do not append AGBs.

	form=brief	Alternate background "brief.eps" form.

	watermark=test	Put the "test.pdf" form into the background.

pdftops: Reads the PDF files generated by the asctopdf filter
and generates PostScript for duplex printing, i.e. with the AGBs on
page 2, all other even pages empty.

Options:

	agb=0		Insert empty pages but don't move the AGBs.

asctops: Ties asctopdf and pdftops together.
This script takes care of the # of copies parameter ($4).

Options:

	None.
